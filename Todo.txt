- Added the server architecture, some basic configuration, some boilerplate files 
and a database configuration.
- I have tested and the server was building and running, but I haven't tested with an example

--> Change the directory where the generated typescript models go
right now going to client/....., our is different; --> DONE

--> Test server with a basic request and websocket connection;

Notes for others:
- You need to add a .env file with CONN_STR="", and inside the "" 
you place the connection string.

General Notes:
On Alex template he has a ApplicationBaseDto that I think it's because of MQTT.
So in case we don't need it we don't use it.

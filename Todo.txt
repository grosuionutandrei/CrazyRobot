What I did:
- Added the server architecture, some basic configuration, some boilerplate files 
and a database configuration.

Todo:
-> Implementation of surveys.

General Notes:
- You need to add a .env file with CONN_STR="" 
Inside the "" you place the connection string.
- If you guys need any of the MQTT stuff, check Alex's template:
https://github.com/uldahlalex/fs25_14_2/tree/master/template_onion_with_mqtt
- I can't deploy because I can't configure secrets on the repository.

What I did:
- Added the server architecture, some basic configuration, some boilerplate files 
and a database configuration.
- I have tested and the server was building and running, but I haven't tested with Postman

Todo:
--> Test server with a basic request and websocket connection -> Postman;

General Notes:
- You need to add a .env file with CONN_STR="" 
Inside the "" you place the connection string.
- If you guys need any of the MQTT stuff, check Alex's template:

What I did:
- Added the server architecture, some basic configuration, some boilerplate files 
and a database configuration.

Todo:
-> Implementation of surveys:
    - Implement SurveysController.cs;
    - Implement Surveys service;
    - Implement Surveys repository;
    - Check if its working;
    - MAKE TESTS!

-> Improve validation related to the surveys and answers;

-> Reformat the code to handle multiple transitions (on create and update)

General Notes:
- You need to add a .env file with CONN_STR="" 
Inside the "" you place the connection string.

- If you guys need any of the MQTT stuff, check Alex's template:

- I can't deploy because I can't configure secrets on the repository --> Andrei please check if you can give access, or you need to do it :)

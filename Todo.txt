Todo:

-> Improve validation related to the surveys and answers;

-> Reformat the code to handle multiple transitions (on create and update);

-> Make TESTS!

-> Also, .env files are in github?  --> Check if fixed after I make a pull request to main;

----> implement the registration of guest (only for surveys and only email);

-> Implement the http client on the frontend (use http.api.NameOfApiCall);




NOTES:

- SQL drop:
drop schema if exists crazyrobot cascade;
create schema if not exists crazyrobot;

- package.json "@tailwindcss/oxide-win32-x64-msvc": "^4.1.4"" --> Can't install on macOS, not sure where it's used...
